# Identification of Undervalued Companies (Financial Analysis)
This project entails analysis on compnaies that are considered undervalues based on the needed criteria. With use of FINVIZ,  the undervalued companies were identified and this project delves deeper into the analysis. This project aims to identify 4 undervalued companies using Finviz (a popular financial visualization and analysis tool for stock market data) by examining gross profit (GP) and gross profit growth (GPG) compared to similar companies in the same sector and develop a valuation model to project the company’s true value in four years. 

Factors determining a company’s undervaluation includes:
1. Low P/E (price to earnings ratio)
2. Low P/B (price to book ratio)
3. Low PEG (price to earnings growth)
4. High dividend relative to peers
5. An increasing trend in GP (Gross Profit) and GPG (Gross Profit Growth) relative to peers.

### PROJECT OBJECTIVES 
- Conduct an analysis to identify 4 undervalued companies using Finviz by examining gross profit (GP) and gross profit growth (GPG) compared to similar companies in the same sector.
